# Run Function

In C# you will compile many functions and you will want to be able to test them to make sure your application is running how you want it.

A command that will help you accomplish this is the 'run' command.

The dotnet run command depends on the dotnet build command to build the code, and allows for fast iterative from the command line.

To run your program, open your command terminal and enter the following.

```
dotnet run
```

If you need help with the dotnet run command you can always insert the below code into the command line

```
dotnet run -help
```
